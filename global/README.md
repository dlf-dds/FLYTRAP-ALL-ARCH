# Global DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS

Find the md rendering in the sub directory with the diagram, with a README.md file that explains the diagram and its purpose.

The Global Data Flows that we have established are:

(Comerrcial global flows)
- **core4ce**
- **CIS-EN PQC**

(Global, JOINT, Across Classification Levels)
- **UDL mainline** (high level view of UDL to multiple consumers)
- **UDL to JFN**
- **UDL to Project Overmatch**

(Theater-Centric, but global distribution to GCP peer, NGC2, with emphasis on NATO sharing)
- **USAREUR TDP mainline** (high level view of TDP to multiple consumers)
- **USAREUR TDP to NGC2**
- **USAREUR TDP to NGA's MSS IL6 and the MPN HOSTED MSS**
- **USAREUR TDP to TAC SIPR TDP**
- **USAREUR TDP to GCCS to NATO Allies**

# Global Data Flow Lines of Effort (LOEs) In the Works
- **Commercial Cloud Directly to the Nett Warrior Cloud**
- **Commercial Cloud into Catalyst and Directly to Mission Partners capable of consuming from Catalyst**

We will want to enable at the lowest level of classification (commercial transport, zero trust security practices) sharing and insights from Sky Fortress Acoustic Sensor and similar unclassified data sources. We will look at leveraging [Catalyst](https://github.com/orbisoperations/catalyst) for this.
