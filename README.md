# FLYTRAP-ALL-ARCH
## Network Architecture Overview

At JOINT EX FLYTRAP / VANNEHEIM, the following diagrams illustrate how the network operates and how data flows both locally and globally. Refer to the `.drawio` files as authoritative sources; the `.png` images are generated from these files.

### Baseline

- **baseline**  
    Shows the core networking and architecture at EX FLYTRAP.

- **baseline-realops**  
    Illustrates the architecture with more than one 2CR SQDN. Note: these cannot communicate directly with each otherâ€”they must route up and out into the Nett Warrior cloud and back.

### Global

- **wideview-core4ce**  
    Demonstrates collaboration with core4ce to enrich data with operationally relevant information, expedite its return to the warfighter, and share it with other environments for broader learning and action.
