## Network Architecture Overview

At JOINT EX FLYTRAP / VANAHEIM, the following diagrams illustrate how the network operates and how data flows both locally and globally. Refer to the `.drawio` files as authoritative sources; the `.png` images are generated from these files.

### Baseline

- **baseline**  
    Shows the core networking and architecture at EX FLYTRAP.

- **baseline-realops**  
    Illustrates the architecture with more than one 2CR SQDN. Note: these cannot communicate directly with each otherâ€”they must route up and out into the Nett Warrior cloud and back.

### Simplified

- **simplified-wideview-core**  
    Presents the core EX FLYTRAP architecture in a condensed form, preparing it for global data flow presentation.

### Global

See GLobal Data Flow Diagrams in separate README files nearest to the diagram, for a broader view of how data is shared and utilized across different environments.

[Global Data Flow Diagrams](global/README.md)
As an example, here is one of the global data flow diagrams:

- **full picture: all the data flows established in EX FLY TRAP**  
    Demonstrates collaboration with many data brokering and command and control systems.

- **full picture with status**  
    Demonstrates our progress in establishing data flows coming out of EX FLYTRAP 3.0, leading into 4.0.
